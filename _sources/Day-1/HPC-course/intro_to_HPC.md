# High Performance Computing

High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the practice of aggregating computing power in a way that delivers much higher performance than one could get out of a typical desktop computer or workstation. HPC is used to solve complex computational problems that require significant processing power and speed.

## What is HPC?

HPC involves the use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques to run advanced applications efficiently, reliably, and quickly. Supercomputers are composed of thousands of compute nodes that work together to perform large-scale computations. These systems are capable of processing vast amounts of data and performing trillions of calculations per second.

## Importance of HPC

HPC is crucial in various fields such as scientific research, engineering, and data analysis. It enables researchers and engineers to solve complex problems that are otherwise impossible to tackle with standard computing resources. Some of the key areas where HPC is essential include:

- **Climate Modeling**: Simulating and predicting climate changes and weather patterns.
- **Genomics**: Analyzing genetic data to understand diseases and develop treatments.
- **Physics**: Conducting simulations of physical phenomena, such as particle collisions.
- **Engineering**: Designing and testing new materials, structures, and products.
- **Finance**: Performing risk analysis and modeling financial markets.

## Components of HPC

HPC systems are composed of several key components:

- **Compute Nodes**: Individual computers that perform the calculations. Each node typically contains multiple processors (CPUs) and memory.
- **Interconnect**: A high-speed network that connects the compute nodes, allowing them to communicate and share data quickly.
- **Storage**: Large-scale storage systems that store the data used and generated by HPC applications.
- **Software**: Specialized software, including operating systems, middleware, and applications, that manage and execute HPC workloads.

## Parallel Computing

One of the fundamental concepts in HPC is parallel computing. This involves dividing a large problem into smaller sub-problems that can be solved concurrently. There are two main types of parallelism:

- **Data Parallelism**: Distributing data across multiple processors and performing the same operation on each subset of data.
- **Task Parallelism**: Distributing different tasks across multiple processors, where each processor performs a different operation.

## Benefits of HPC

The primary benefits of HPC include:

- **Speed**: HPC systems can perform complex calculations much faster than traditional computers.
- **Efficiency**: HPC allows for the efficient use of resources, reducing the time and cost required to solve large-scale problems.
- **Scalability**: HPC systems can scale to accommodate larger problems by adding more compute nodes.
- **Innovation**: HPC enables breakthroughs in science, engineering, and industry by providing the computational power needed to explore new ideas and solutions.

## Challenges in HPC

Despite its advantages, HPC also presents several challenges:

- **Cost**: Building and maintaining HPC systems can be expensive.
- **Complexity**: Developing and optimizing applications for HPC systems requires specialized knowledge and skills.
- **Energy Consumption**: HPC systems consume significant amounts of energy, leading to high operational costs and environmental impact.

In this chapter we shall go through how to use HPC resources through Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM).
William & Mary HPC has several nodes and manages its job execution through `SLURM` and `PBS`. Check out the properties for various nodes at College of William & Mary [here](https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/services/researchcomputing/hw/nodes/)
